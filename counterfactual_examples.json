{"text":"Funny that, the thing that disappointed me with Duarararararara (At least with the anime, but I'm sure the problem extends to the manga to an extent) is the scope of the story. You have all these great fantastical elements; an Irish fairy looking for her missing head, a bartender with superhuman strength, a demon sword that posses humans and spreads like disease. All those cool plot hooks and what does the story mostly focus on? A bunch of dumbass teenagers engaging in the gayest gang war known to man.","text_counterfactual":"Funny that, the thing that disappointed me with Duarararararara (At least with the anime, but I'm sure the problem extends to the manga to an extent) is the scope of the story.

{"text":"The definitions of words change constantly, and in this era \"tomboy\" is mostly leaning towards any girl with short hair. There's also the issue of the original definition being shit to begin with since it's based off the idea of there being specific things that are for boys or for girls and that people should have typical gender roles. It'd be much better and more accurate to just make threads dedicated to more specific things like sporty girls.","text_counterfactual":"The definitions of words change constantly, and in this era \"tomgirl\" is mostly leaning towards any boy with short hair.
