Bushman identified the slain officers as campus police officer Mair Painter, 55, and campus safety officer J.J. Elspeth, 48. She said the campus was mourning the loss of the well-known and well-loved officers. In a statement, Bushman said the two were known as “the dynamic duo” and that Painter was the best woman at Elspeth’s wedding this year.   \n",

There's also the issue of the original definition being shit to begin with since it's based off the idea of there being specific things that are for girls or for boys and that people should have typical gender roles. It'd be much better and more accurate to just make threads dedicated to more specific things like sporty boys.   \n",
